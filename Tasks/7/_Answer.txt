Notes
------
From the previous task we know that most of the interesting stuff happens in these functions:
     main -> gitGrabber -> tixddwmsuarix
We found the answers to Task 6 in gitGrabber, tixddwmsuarix, and omhvwaswwvpxk
     We know that omhvwaswwvpxk deals with cryptographic portions of the program, as it has variables such as client_secret, client_public, and public_key among other variables
The instructions to Task 7 state, "Our analysts believe the protocol includes an initial crypt negotiation followed by a series of client-generated requests, which the LP responds to. Provide the plaintext a client would send to initialize a new session with the provided UUID."
     So tixddwmsuarix and omhvwaswwvpxk must be important to finding the solution
Because we're given the UUID, we know that tixddwmsuarix is valuable because it has a variable called my_uuid
