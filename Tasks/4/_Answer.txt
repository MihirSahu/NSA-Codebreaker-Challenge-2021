1. Examine the payoad, understand what it's doing.
However knowing what it does in every command is not necessary to solve this.

2. .ppk files without any encryption (look at the 'Encryption:' section in the ppk file)
    dkr_prd52.ppk
    dkr_tst32.ppk
    dkr_tst46.ppk
    dkr_tst80.ppk
    dkr_tst81.ppk

Assuming that 'prd' are the machines in production and 'tst' are machine that are just being tested, there's only one machine that didn't have the private key encrypted: dkr_prd52.ppk

3. Now simple open the NTUSER.DAT file in the HKEY_USERS registry on windows by using the "Load Hive" option on the registry editor, name it whatever you want (I named it Codebreaker) and go to Computer\HKEY_USERS\Codebreaker\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\dkr_prd52

4. Now go to the 'HostName' key and you'll see the answer in the format <username>@<machine name>, like you use in ssh

5. So the answer is builder05@dkr_prd52
