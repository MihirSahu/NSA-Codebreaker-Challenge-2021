Steps
------
1. Use the IP address that all the DIB IP address communicated with (10.61.135.118) and find that address on the proxy.log file
2. After finding the address on the proxy.log file, find the IP address that it's associated with on the same line of the file (172.26.161.73)
3. Now take the address you found and search for it in the logins.json file until you find it in an ipv4 format (like this: "RemoteHost": "- (172.26.161.73)")
4. The logon ID should be on that line
