1. Go to the original image.tar and load it into dock by using "docker image load -i image.tar"
2. Run the image with "docker run -d --name <what you want the container name> image.tar /bin/bash tail -f /dev/null". The /bin/bash tail -f /dev/null is not necessary for running it but is needed for analysis because otherwise the container exits within seconds; by adding it the container has a continous stream of instructions, and doesn't exit

#Do 3 and 4 if you want to export the file from the container
#3. Export the container's file system using 'docker container export -o <output file name> <container name>'
#4. Go to /usr/bin and copy the make file to another directory for analysis

5. Enter the container by using "docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash"
6. We know from the config files that this container uses alpine linux, which uses the apk package manager, so we can install the tools we need inside the container itself
   1. GDB (Gnu Project Debugger) - we need this to see what's going on when the binary runs
