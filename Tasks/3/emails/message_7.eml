Hey Roy!

Wanted to send over my new email address! I think I now have five
email addresses...but I'm mainly using this one now. One day life
will be more simple. :)

Looking forward to hosting you one evening when the COVID environment allows!

Please reach out if I can help with anything.

All the best,
Amelia
